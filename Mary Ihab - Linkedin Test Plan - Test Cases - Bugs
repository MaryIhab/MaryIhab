# 1Introduction

The Test Plan has been created to communicate the test approach to team members. It includes the objectives, scope, schedule, risks and approach. This document will clearly identify what the test deliverables will be and what is deemed in and out of scope.

## 1.1Objectives

**LinkedIn**  is an American [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business) and employment-oriented online service that operates via [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) and [mobile apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_apps). The platform is mainly used for [professional networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_network), and allows job seekers to post their [CVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae) and employers to post [jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job).

This Phase of the project will deliver Linkedin Mobile App with new functionalities and bug fixes. This will allow the app to be more usable and preferable by all types of users.

## 1.2Team Members

# 2Scope

The initial phase will include all &#39;must have&#39; requirements. These and any other requirements that get included must all be tested. At the end of this Phase, a user must be able to:

1. Membership (Register new accounts, manage accounts)
2. Job seeking (Recruiters post jobs and seekers could apply for the jobs)
3. Premium Accounts (some extra features to be available, payment methods to be handled)
4. Push Notifications
5. Companies and Job Seekers can display their profiles professionally

As the team works with the product they will define the needs for the second phase.

Load testing will not be considered part of this project since the user base is known and not an issue.

# 3Assumptions / Risks

## 3.1Assumptions

This section lists assumptions that are made specific to this project.

## 3.2Risks

The following risks have been identified and the appropriate action identified to mitigate their impact on the project. The impact (or severity) of the risk is based on how the project would be affected if the risk was triggered. The trigger is what milestone or event would cause the risk to become an issue to be dealt with.
